# monitord

monitord ... know how happy your systemd is! ðŸ˜Š

We offer the following run modes:

- systemd-timer (legacy cron would work too)
  - Refer to monitord.timer and monitord.service unit files
  - Ensure no `daemon:` mode options are set in `monitord.conf`
- daemon mode
  - Enable daemon mode in configuration file
  - Stats will be written to stdout every `daemon_stats_refresh_secs`
- [promethus-exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) daemon
  - Recommended to use monitord.service + set a non 0 prometheus_exporter in `monitord.conf`

`monitord` is a config driven binary. We plan to keep CLI arguments to a minimum.

**INFO** level logging is enabled to stderr by default. Use `-v` to increase (DEBUG) and `-q` to reduce logging.

## Install

Install via cargo or use as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.

- `cargo install monitord`
- Create (copy from repo) a `monitord.conf`
  - Defaults to looking for it at /etc/monitord.conf
- `monitord --help`

```console
crl-m1:monitord cooper$ monitord --help
monitord 0.6.9

### Config

monitord can have the different components monitored. To enable / disabled set the 
following in our monitord.conf. This file is [ini format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file)
to match systemd unit files.

```ini
[monitord]
debug=false
# onetime run (cron/systemd timer) output format
# Supported: json, json-flat, json-pretty
output_format=json
# Run as a daemon or now
# Time to refresh systemd stats in seconds
# Daemon mode only
daemon_stats_refresh_secs=60

[journald]
enabled=no

[networkd]
enabled=true
link_state_dir=/run/systemd/netif/links

[units]
enabled=no

# Daemon Mode options

[daemon:prometheus_exporter]
# We recommend TCP port 1 due to this monitoring PID 1 :)
# Set a port >= 1 to listen
port = 1
```

## Output Formats

### json

Normal `serde_json` non pretty JSON. All on one line. Most compact format.

### json-flat

Move all key value pairs to the top level and . notate compononets + sub values.
Is semi pretty too + custom. All unittested ...

## Development

To do test runs (requires `systemd` and `systemd-networkd` *installed*)
- Pending what you have enabled in your config ...

- `cargo run -- -c monitord.conf -v`

Ensure the following pass before submitting a PR (CI checks):

- `cargo test`
- `cargo clippy`
- `cargo fmt`
